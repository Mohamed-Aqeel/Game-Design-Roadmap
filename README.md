# **INTRO**
Game designing is the process of creating the rules, mechanics, story, and aesthetics of a video game. Game designers work with programmers, artists, writers, and other professionals to turn their vision into a playable experience. Game designing can be challenging, rewarding, and fun, depending on the type and scope of the game. Some game designers focus on specific aspects of the game, such as level design, narrative design, or user interface design, while others oversee the whole project from start to finish. Game designing requires creativity, problem-solving skills, communication skills, and knowledge of game theory and psychology.
